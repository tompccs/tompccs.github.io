It's increasingly clear to me that the lunch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2023 was Google's "Kodak moment". Google, whose mission is to "organise the world's information and make it universally useful", somehow managed to fumble the opportunity to launch the most significant product in that space for perhaps all of history, despite their own researchers writing the seminal paper which underlies ChatGPT and having unmatched access to compute and training data. 

Google's business model is targeted ads, and it's already competing on one front with Meta, who target using personal analytics and engagement. If Google Search loses traffic to ChatGPT, that means it has to double-down on YouTube's fight for a slice of the screen-based leisure market against not only Meta and other social media challengers (TikTok, Snapchat), but also content producers like Netflix, Disney, game studios and basically the whole media landscape. Google has no real foothold in audio (podcasts, audio books), something which may be crucial for next-gen augmented reality computing, another area in which Google could not convert a technology advantage into a commercial one. 

If Google had more inspired leadership, it would accept the colossal revenue hit of replacing the search box on their home page with the Gemini chat interface. But, like Kodak selling film at record volumes just as digital cameras become viable consumer products, their executives know that their comp depends on the short-term stock movements, and cratering their stock price with a few bad quarters necessary to truly steer the company away from disaster is just not in their self-interest.
