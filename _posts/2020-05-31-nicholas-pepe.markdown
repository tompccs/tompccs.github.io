I recalled getting 90 100 100 respectively for those three separate tasks during the face to face assessment, but the final mark turns out to be only 70. I remembered that the uploaded code check is said to be only a precaution check and wouldn't have much effect on the final mark.

I can assure you that I wrote all the code on my own without any help from other people or any unauthorized reference to other people's work. Java Programming module is my favorite among all second-year courses. A lot of my time and effort is dedicated to these assignments in order to make the code as perfect as possible, and I have enjoyed every second of it. Therefore, it really hurts when I'm being regarded as suspect of copying. I'm writing this email to humbly ask for more clarification on this feedback as well as the reason why such a low score is received.

It is true that the lab examination mark was 90 but then your
marker decided to drop to 70 upon examining your code.

"package com.nicolaspepe;" which certainly raises a few eyebrows
re possible copying.

I'll have another look at the code and let you know.

However if you can explain why you have called your package "com.nicholaspepe" then I will review the mark.
